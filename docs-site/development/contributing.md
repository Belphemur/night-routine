## Code Contributions

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `main`
2. **Make your changes**
3. **Write/update tests**
4. **Run linters and tests**
5. **Commit with conventional commits**
6. **Push to your fork**
7. **Open a pull request**

### Coding Standards

#### Go Style Guide

Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) and [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).

**Key points:**
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write clear variable names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Handle errors explicitly

**Example:**
```go
// CalculateFairness determines which parent should be assigned
// based on historical assignments and configured availability.
// It returns the chosen parent and the decision reason.
func CalculateFairness(config Config, date time.Time) (string, Reason, error) {
    if err := validateConfig(config); err != nil {
        return "", "", fmt.Errorf("invalid config: %w", err)
    }
    
    // Implementation...
    return parent, reason, nil
}
```

#### Code Organization

```
internal/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package/              # Package directory
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.go       # Main package logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package_test.go  # Tests
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.go         # Type definitions (if many types)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        # Package documentation (for complex packages)
```

#### Linting

Pass `golangci-lint` checks:

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

**Fix automatically when possible:**
```bash
golangci-lint run --fix
```

### Testing Requirements

#### Test Coverage

- All new code must include tests
- Maintain or improve overall coverage
- Aim for 70%+ coverage on new code

**Run tests:**
```bash
go test -v -cover ./...
```

#### Test Quality

- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use meaningful test names
- Keep tests independent

**Example:**
```go
func TestParentAssignment(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name           string
        availability   Availability
        date           time.Time
        expectedParent string
        expectedReason Reason
    }{
        {
            name: "parent A unavailable on Monday",
            availability: Availability{
                ParentAUnavailable: []string{"Monday"},
            },
            date:           parseDate("2024-01-01"), // Monday
            expectedParent: "ParentB",
            expectedReason: Unavailability,
        },
        // More test cases...
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            parent, reason, err := AssignParent(tt.availability, tt.date)
            require.NoError(t, err)
            assert.Equal(t, tt.expectedParent, parent)
            assert.Equal(t, tt.expectedReason, reason)
        })
    }
}
```

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

**Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions/changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

**Examples:**

```bash
# Simple feature
feat: add monthly statistics export

# Bug fix with details
fix(fairness): correct consecutive limit calculation

Previously, the consecutive limit was not properly reset
when a parent became unavailable, leading to incorrect
assignments.

Fixes #123

# Breaking change
feat(config)!: change TOML structure for parent settings

BREAKING CHANGE: Parent configuration now uses nested
structure instead of flat fields. Update your config:

Before:
  parent_a = "Alice"
  
After:
  [parents]
  parent_a = "Alice"
```

docs-site/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ installation/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configuration/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-guide/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture/

### Writing Documentation

**Guidelines:**
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Add screenshots for UI features
- Use admonitions for important notes
- Link to related pages

**Example admonitions:**
```markdown
!!! note "Configuration Note"
    This setting requires a restart.

!!! warning "Breaking Change"
    This feature changes the API.

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    Use this for better performance.

!!! danger "Security Warning"
    Never commit credentials.
```

### Building Documentation Locally

```bash
# Install MkDocs and dependencies
pip install mkdocs-material

# Serve documentation locally
mkdocs serve

# Open http://localhost:8000
```

## Release Process

Releases are automated via semantic-release and GitHub Actions.

### Semantic Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for new functionality (backward compatible)
- **PATCH** version for bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Workflow

1. Commits to `main` trigger semantic-release
2. Semantic-release analyzes commit messages
3. Version is determined automatically
4. CHANGELOG is updated
5. Git tag is created
6. GitHub Release is created
7. Binaries and Docker images are built
8. Documentation is published

### Commit Message Impact

| Commit Type | Release Type |
|------------|--------------|
| `fix:` | PATCH (0.0.x) |
| `feat:` | MINOR (0.x.0) |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:` | MAJOR (x.0.0) |
| `docs:`, `test:`, etc. | No release |
