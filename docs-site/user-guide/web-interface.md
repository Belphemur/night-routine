# Web Interface Guide

The Night Routine Scheduler web interface provides an intuitive way to manage your night routine schedule, view statistics, and control synchronization.

## Home Page

The home page (`/`) is your main dashboard for managing night routine assignments.

### Authentication Status

At the top of the page, you'll see your connection status:

=== "Connected"
    ```
    ‚úÖ Connected to Google Calendar
    üìÖ Using calendar: Night Routine
    ```

=== "Not Connected"
    ```
    ‚ùå Not connected to Google Calendar
    [Connect Google Calendar Button]
    ```

### Visual Monthly Calendar

The centerpiece of the home page is a visual calendar showing the current month's assignments.

#### Color Coding

- **Blue background** - Parent A is assigned
- **Orange background** - Parent B is assigned  
- **Yellow border** - Today's date
- **Gray background** - Days from previous/next month (padding)

#### Assignment Details

=== "Desktop"
    **Hover** over any date to see:
    
    - Parent name
    - Decision reason (why this parent was assigned)
    - Date

=== "Mobile"
    **Tap** on any date to toggle the decision reason display. Tap again to hide.

#### Decision Reasons

Each assignment includes a reason explaining why that parent was chosen:

| Reason | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Unavailability** | The other parent was unavailable on this day |
| **Total Count** | This parent has fewer total assignments |
| **Recent Count** | This parent has had fewer recent assignments |
| **Consecutive Limit** | Prevents too many consecutive assignments |
| **Alternating** | Maintains an alternating pattern |
| **Override** | Manually changed via Google Calendar |

    - Create initial night routine events
    - Redirect you to the home page

### Changing Calendars

To switch to a different calendar:

1. From the home page, click "Change Calendar"
2. Select a new calendar from the list
3. The application will:
    - **Delete** all existing night routine events from the old calendar
    - **Create** new events in the new calendar
    - **Update** webhook subscriptions

!!! warning "Calendar Switch Impact"
    Switching calendars will remove all night routine events from the previous calendar. This action cannot be undone.

## Statistics Page

The statistics page (`/statistics`) provides a historical view of assignment distribution.

### Monthly Breakdown

Displays a table showing:

| Month | Parent A | Parent B | Total |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| Jan 2024 | 15 | 16 | 31 |
| Feb 2024 | 14 | 14 | 28 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Features

- **Last 12 months** - Shows up to 12 months of historical data
- **Only assigned months** - Months without assignments are hidden
- **Fair distribution verification** - Quickly see if assignments are balanced
- **Total counts** - Sum of assignments per month

### Interpreting Statistics

**Balanced distribution:**
```
Month     | Parent A | Parent B | Total
----------|----------|----------|------
Jan 2024  | 15       | 16       | 31
```
‚úÖ Difference of 1 is normal for odd-day months

**Imbalanced distribution:**
```
Month     | Parent A | Parent B | Total
----------|----------|----------|------
Jan 2024  | 20       | 11       | 31
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Large difference may indicate:

- One parent has more unavailable days
- Manual overrides have skewed the distribution
- Configuration issues

## Troubleshooting

### Calendar Not Updating

**Problem:** Changes don't appear after clicking "Sync Now"

**Solutions:**

1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check application logs for errors

### Assignment Details Not Showing (Mobile)

**Problem:** Tapping dates doesn't show decision reasons

**Solutions:**

1. Ensure JavaScript is enabled
2. Try tapping directly on the date number
3. Refresh the page
4. Check browser compatibility

### Webhook Notifications Not Working

**Problem:** Manual changes in Google Calendar don't reflect immediately

**Solutions:**

1. Check application logs for webhook errors
2. Verify `public_url` is accessible from the internet
3. Test by manually clicking "Sync Now"
4. Webhook may need to be renewed (happens automatically)

### Page Layout Issues

**Problem:** Calendar layout is broken or overlapping

**Solutions:**

1. Clear browser cache
2. Disable browser extensions
3. Try a different browser
4. Check browser console for CSS errors

## Best Practices

### Regular Checks

- Review the calendar weekly to ensure proper scheduling
- Check statistics monthly to verify fair distribution
- Sync manually after configuration changes

### Calendar Hygiene

- Don't manually delete night routine events in Google Calendar (change the parent instead)
- Use the web interface for changing calendars
- Let automatic sync handle routine updates

### Performance

- Minimize frequent manual syncs (let automatic updates handle it)
- Use statistics page sparingly (it processes historical data)
- Clear old browser data periodically
